    "1. Dynamical system theory behavior of the variables involved in the system. Applied to co-regulation, this idea implies that it is possible to understand a relational process, such as co-regulation, by **observing the behavior of the individuals involved in the relationship.** This idea is commonly referred to as 'emergence' in the dynamical systems literature, and suggests that the 'how' is a much more difficult question to assess, if not impossible, and instead a researcher's focus should be on what emerges. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamical systems theory assumes that the ways a system changes over time are best understood **in terms of patterns (what emerges), which means that variables tend to change over time in a predictable fashion or fashions **(e.g., oscillating about a single point, escalating over time, etc.). Applied to co-regulation, this idea suggests that co-regualtion can be described as partners' typical responses to each other's behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamical system theory assumes that **some patterns of change over time are more likely to occur than others.** Applied to co-regulation, this idea implies that even though partners may have typical ways of responding to one another, it is also possible, though less likely, for them to deviate from their typical response. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. These patterns differ in their inherent stability, and **many of the patterns are, in fact, defined by reactions to outside forces generating temporary divergences from the pattern.** Applied to co-regulation, this idea implies that our descriptive of a typical response is really the degree to which the typical response is able to be amintained despite constant forces that could lead to diverging from that response pattern."
